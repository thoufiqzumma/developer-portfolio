            <h3>About Me </h3>
            <p>I am a person who is positive about every aspect of life. There are many things I like to do, to see, and
                to
                experience. . I like to read, I like to write; I like to think, I like to dream; I like to talk, I like
                to
                listen. I like to see the sunrise in the morning, I like to see the moonlight at night; I like to feel
                the
                music
                flowing on my face, I like to smell the wind coming from the ocean.</p>

            <h1>My Hobby</h1>
            <h3>Become a web developer</h3>
            <p>I like to look at the clouds in the sky with a blank mind, I like to do thought experiment when I cannot
                sleep in the middle of the night. I like flowers in spring, rain in summer, leaves in autumn, and snow
                in winter.
                I like to sleep early, I like to get up late; I like to be alone, I like to be surrounded by people. I
                like countryâ€™s peace.I like delicious food and comfortable shoes; I like good books and romantic movies.
                I like the land and the nature, I like people. And, I like to laugh.</p>
